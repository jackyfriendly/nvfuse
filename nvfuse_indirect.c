/**
*	ext2_find_shared - find the indirect blocks for partial truncation.
*	@inode:	  inode in question
*	@depth:	  depth of the affected branch
*	@offsets: offsets of pointers in that branch (see ext2_block_to_path)
*	@chain:	  place to store the pointers to partial indirect blocks
*	@top:	  place to the (detached) top of branch
*
*	This is a helper function used by ext2_truncate().
*
*	When we do truncate() we may have to clean the ends of several indirect
*	blocks but leave the blocks themselves alive. Block is partially
*	truncated if some data below the new i_size is referred from it (and
*	it is on the path to the first completely truncated data block, indeed).
*	We have to free the top of that path along with everything to the right
*	of the path. Since no allocation past the truncation point is possible
*	until ext2_truncate() finishes, we may safely do the latter, but top
*	of branch may require special attention - pageout below the truncation
*	point might try to populate it.
*
*	We atomically detach the top of branch from the tree, store the block
*	number of its root in *@top, pointers to buffer_heads of partially
*	truncated blocks - in @chain[].bh and pointers to their last elements
*	that should not be removed - in @chain[].p. Return value is the pointer
*	to last filled element of @chain.
*
*	The work left to caller to do the actual freeing of subtrees:
*		a) free the subtree starting from *@top
*		b) free the subtrees whose roots are stored in
*			(@chain[i].p+1 .. end of @chain[i].bh->b_data)
*		c) free the subtrees growing from the inode past the @chain[0].p
*			(no partially truncated stuff there).
